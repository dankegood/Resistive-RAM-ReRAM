# Resistive-RAM-ReRAM
Test commercial ReRAM chip for radiation hardness and functionality for military and space applications

Form communication between the ReRAM chip and the host using Arduino UNO micro-controller board

Write/Read of consecutive bit patterns to the ReRAM chip using the built-in op-code was performed using Arduino programming language with SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)

Test code, using C language, for characterizing the standby current, power dissipation, and programming performance was implemented to quantify the bit error rate on the ReRAM chip using a checkerboard algorithm

Validate the validity of ReRAM chip use for the digital signal under heavy radiation
